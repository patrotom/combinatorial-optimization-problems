We use to comparison to determine if we have already solved one of the branches of recursion. If the `price` is greater or equal to the current optimal price and the `weight` is less than or equal to the knapsack capacity, we update the `solution` object with the new values – `price` and vector configuration `conf`.\n",

To cover the whole state space, we have to call the recursion with the current bit set to either $0$ or $1$. We also have to recalculate the price and weight. We later send them the recursion if the bit is set to $1$ – it means that the item is added to the knapsack. In this way, we construct the whole state space and find the optimal solution."
