    "# 1 Knapsack Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem is one of the most trivial NP-hard problems. We can encounter many of its variants in the literature, which generally have various solution requirements for the algorithm. The formulation always contains criterium for the overall price, which means it is an optimization problem.\n",

We decide whether the problem is solvable by comparing the optimal price and the minimal required price $B$. The problem is solvable if the resulting price meets the requirements described in the **section 1.2**.\n",

    "## 2.1 Brute Force\n",
    "\n",
    "In the brute force approach, we search (almost) the whole state space to find the optimal price and configuration. The truth is that we do not go through the entire state space – that's why almost. We add a simple condition that cuts the recursion branch if adding an item would result in the overloaded knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at the code snippet of the algorithm:\n",

    "    if i == instance.size:\n",
    "        solution.complexity += 1\n",
    "        if price >= solution.price:\n",
    "            solution.price = price\n",
    "            solution.weight = weight\n",
    "            solution.conf = conf\n",
    "        return\n",

    "    new_weight = instance.items[i].weight + weight\n",
    "\n",
    "    conf[i] = 1\n",
    "    if new_weight <= instance.capacity:\n",
    "        new_price = instance.items[i].price + price\n",
    "        brute_force(conf, i + 1, new_weight, new_price)\n",
    "\n",
    "    conf[i] = 0\n",
    "    brute_force(conf, i + 1, weight, price)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by comparing the current depth of the recursion `i` with the size of the instance. We use to comparison to determine if we have already solved one of the branches of recursion. We increment the counter of the complexity – we later use this data in the analysis. If the `price` is greater or equal to the current optimal price, we update the `solution` object with the new values – `price`, `weight`, and vector configuration `conf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we compute a new weight by adding the current weight to the particular items' weight. To cover the whole state space, we have to call the recursion with the current bit set to either $0$ or $1$. We also have to recalculate the price and weight. We later send them the recursion if the bit is set to $1$ – it means that the item is added to the knapsack. Also, as mentioned above, we call the recursion with the added item only if the recalculated weight is less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack – we don't overload the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm searches (almost) the entire state space and correctly computes the optimal price. The configuration, weight, and optimal price are stored in the `solution` object. We further use this objects' data in the **section 3** (analysis) and to answer the question of whether a particular instance is solvable or not."
